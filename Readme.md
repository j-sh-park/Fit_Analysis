# Personal Informatics - Step Count Analysis and Adherence

## Driving Question
Driving Question 1: Did I achieve my goal of X steps more in the last 12 months than the 12 months before that?
Driving Question 2: Do I have more steps on average during the weekend in comparison to a weekday?

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to answer the driving question; did Person 1 or Person 2 achieve X amount of steps more in the past 12 months compared to the 12 months before that. Analysis was performed on the two data sets provided, to determine if each person achieved their target. Cleaning the data sets, aggregation methods (day, month step countss), and advanced visual techniques were deployed to analyze and answer the first driving question.

The second driving question was to determine if Person 1 or Person 2 walked more steps on a weekend rather than on a weekday. The hypothesis made was that people will generally be more physically active on the weekend, rather than on a weekday; therefore, the second driving question was to analyse the data sets to prove or disprove this hypothesis.
